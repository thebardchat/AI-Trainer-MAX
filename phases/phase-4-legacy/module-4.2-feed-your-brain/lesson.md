# Module 4.2 — Feed Your Brain

## WHAT YOU'LL BUILD

A brain loaded with YOUR knowledge — your family values, your personal memories, and your hard-won life lessons. By the end of this module, you'll have added meaningful entries to both the Knowledge collection and the Personal Vault, then proven you can search and find them by meaning.

This is the difference between an empty house and a home. Module 4.1 showed you the rooms. Now you're hanging the pictures, filling the bookshelves, and putting the family recipes in the kitchen drawer.

## WHO THIS IS FOR

Anyone who has things worth passing down. Parents who want their kids to know what they stood for. People who've learned things the hard way and don't want that wisdom to die with them. You don't need to be a writer — you just need to know what matters to you.

## KEY TERMS

- **add_knowledge**: The MCP tool that adds an entry to the Knowledge collection. You give it content (the knowledge itself), a category (family, faith, technical, philosophy, general, wellness), and an optional title. This is where your values, beliefs, and lessons go.

- **vault_add**: The MCP tool that adds a document to the PersonalDoc collection. You give it content, a category (medical, legal, financial, personal, work), and an optional title. This is where your personal records and memories go.

- **Knowledge vs. Vault**: Knowledge is what you BELIEVE and what you've LEARNED — values, principles, life lessons. The Vault is what you HAVE — documents, records, specific memories with details. Think of Knowledge as the wisdom on the wall plaque, and the Vault as the filing cabinet in the office.

- **Category**: A label that organizes your entries. Knowledge categories: family, faith, technical, philosophy, general, wellness. Vault categories: medical, legal, financial, personal, work. Pick the one that fits best — you can always search across all categories later.

- **Legacy Content**: Entries specifically chosen because they're worth inheriting. Not "pick up milk" — more like "here's what I learned about marriage after 15 years" or "this is the recipe your great-grandmother brought from the old country."

## THE LESSON

### Step 1: Decide what matters

Before you type a single command, think about this: if your kids could ask you anything after you're gone, what would you want them to find?

Most people think of three categories:

**Values** — What you stand for. Your non-negotiables. The principles that guided your decisions. "We don't quit when it gets hard." "Family eats together." "You give your word, you keep it."

**Memories** — The stories that shaped you. The day your first child was born. The job that taught you humility. The moment you knew what you wanted to build. These aren't just nostalgia — they're context for the values.

**Wisdom** — The lessons that cost you something. What you'd tell your 20-year-old self. The mistakes that turned into education. The shortcuts that don't actually work. "Here's what nobody tells you about running a business."

### Step 2: Knowledge entries vs. Vault entries

Use `add_knowledge` for things that are universal and timeless:
- Family values and principles
- Faith foundations
- Life philosophies
- Lessons learned from experience
- Technical knowledge you want preserved

Use `vault_add` for things that are specific and personal:
- Family stories with names, dates, places
- Personal milestones and memories
- Letters to specific people
- Records you want searchable (not passwords — never passwords)
- Recipes, traditions, instructions for specific things

The knowledge base is like a book of proverbs. The vault is like a box of letters and photographs.

### Step 3: Write like you're talking to your kids

Don't write like a textbook. Write like you're sitting on the porch explaining something to someone you love.

Bad: "Financial responsibility is a cornerstone of sustainable household management."

Good: "We don't buy things we can't pay for. Credit cards get paid off every month. If we can't afford it today, we save until we can. Your mama and I agreed on that before we got married and it's saved us more fights than I can count."

The AI stores meaning, not style points. But your kids will search this someday, and they should hear YOUR voice.

### Step 4: Categories are rooms, not walls

Don't overthink categories. If a life lesson about money could be "family" or "philosophy" — pick one and move on. The semantic search doesn't care about the category label. It finds entries by meaning.

Categories help when you want to browse: "Show me everything in the faith category." But search works across all categories: "What did Dad say about hard work?" will find the right entry whether you filed it under family, philosophy, or general.

### Step 5: Start small, build over time

You don't have to fill the brain in one sitting. The exercise adds a few seed entries to get you started. After that, come back whenever something matters enough to preserve.

Some people add one entry a week. Some add ten on a Sunday afternoon. The brain doesn't care about pace — it cares about content. One genuine entry about what you believe is worth more than a hundred entries that say nothing.

## THE PATTERN

```
THINK      -->  CATEGORIZE  -->  STORE         -->  VERIFY
(what        (knowledge or    (add_knowledge    (search and
 matters)     vault? which     or vault_add)      find it)
              category?)
```

This is the feed-and-verify loop. Add something meaningful, then search for it to confirm the brain absorbed it. Every entry you verify is one more piece of you that outlasts you.

## WHAT YOU PROVED

- You can add knowledge entries (values, beliefs, lessons) to the Knowledge collection
- You can add personal memories and records to the Personal Vault
- The brain finds your entries by meaning, not just keywords
- Knowledge and Vault serve different purposes — wisdom vs. records
- Your legacy content is stored locally and searchable by your family
- You started building something that outlasts you

**Next:** Run `exercise.bat` to feed your brain with values, memories, and wisdom.
